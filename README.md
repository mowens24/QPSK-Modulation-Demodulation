# QPSK Modulation/Demodulation Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation and demodulation techniques using Python and GNU Radio.

## Description
- **Objective**: To simulate QPSK signals, focusing on modulation, transmission, and demodulation processes.
- **Current Status**: This project is under active development. The notebook includes initial work with plans for optimization and hardware integration.

## Setup
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- The libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Install the required packages:
